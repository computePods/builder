# Now we specify the certificate key size... the larger you choose the more

# We now specify which machines will run a compute pod

# We can start by specifying the standard defaults for any compute pod 
# interface.

# NOTE: any instance of "$HOME" in the "commons" path (below) will be
#       replaced by the environment variable "HOME" from the machine/user
#       which runs the create subcommand
#
podDefaults:
#   commons: /a/path/to/the/commons
#   hosts: # set in pod
#     - host:ip
#   ports: # set in pod (a *named* hash of port publish statements)
#     web: 0.0.0.0:8080:80
#   volumes: # set in container (all)
#     - /a/host/directory/path:/a/container/directory/path:ro

# Now we specify the compute pods host names as well as any non-standard

#
# Any of the above pod defaults can be specified for a specific computePod 
# and will override those defaults
#
# NOTE: The hosts names should be the name used by your (internal) network
#
# NOTE: If a given host has multiple names in your network, the host names 
# can be a comma separated list of these names.
