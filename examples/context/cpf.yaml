# This YAML file describes the context Compute Pods

# We start by giving a name to this federation of compute pods

# Now we specify the certificate key size... the larger you choose the more 
# secure the communitcation will be... but it will take more time to 
# generate
keySize: 4096

# We must specify details for the Certificate Authority

# We now specify which machines will run a compute pod

# We can start by specifying the standard defaults for any compute pod 
# interface. 
#
# compute pod_defaults:
#   port: 8080

# Now we specify the compute pods host names as well as any non-standard 
# ports....
#
# EXACTLY one of the following compute pods should be declared as the primary 
# compute pod. If there are multiple or none, we choose the first we 
# find... 
#
# NOTE: The hosts names should be the name used by your (internal) network
#
# NOTE: If a given host has multiple names in your network, the host names 
# can be a comma separated list of these names.
